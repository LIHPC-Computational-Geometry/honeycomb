# Workspace

The project root is organized using Cargo workspaces at the moment. This may change when other languages are
introduced to the project.

The repository hosts both published crates (usable content) as well as complementary content such as benchmarks,
examples or this guide.

## Published crates

- [honeycomb](honeycomb.md) *Main crate*
- [honeycomb-core](honeycomb-core.md) *Core definitions and tools for combinatorial map implementation*
- [honeycomb-kernels](honeycomb-kernels.md) *Meshing kernel implementations using combinatorial maps*
- [honeycomb-render](honeycomb-render.md) *Visualization tool for combinatorial maps*

## Other content

- [honeycomb-benches](honeycomb-benches.md) *Benchmarks of the main map structures and methods*
- [honeycomb-examples](honeycomb-examples.md) *Examples of usage of the project's features*
- [honeycomb-guide](honeycomb-guide.md) *Source files of the user guide*

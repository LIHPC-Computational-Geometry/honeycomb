# honeycomb-render

[Documentation](../honeycomb_render/)

--- 

**honeycomb-render** is a Rust crate that provides a simple visualization framework to allow the user to render their
combinatorial map. It is designed to be used directly in the code by reading data through a reference to the map (as
opposed to a binary that would read serialized data).

## Usage

### Quickstart

Because this crate is meant to be used in tandem with other members of the workspace, no quickstart example is provided
in the documentation. Instead, standalone examples provided in the project cover basic usage and parameterization.

### Examples

Examples are provided in the [dedicated crate](./honeycomb-examples.md), under the `examples/render/` directory.

# honeycomb-kernels

[Documentation](../honeycomb_kernels/)

---

**honeycomb-kernels** is a Rust crate that provides implementations of meshing kernels using the core crate's
combinatorial maps. These implementations have multiple purposes:

1. Writing code using n-maps from a user's perspective
2. Covering a wide range of operations, with routines that are more topology-heavy / geometry-heavy / balanced
3. Stressing the data structure, to identify its advantages and its pitfalls in a meshing context
4. Testing for more unwanted behaviors / bugs


## Algorithms

### Grisubal



### Examples

Examples will be provided in the [dedicated crate](./honeycomb-examples.md), under the `examples/kernels/` directory.

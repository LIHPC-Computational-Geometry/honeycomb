# Honeycomb

Honeycomb aims to provide a safe, efficient and scalable implementation of 
combinatorial maps for meshing applications. More specifically, the goal is
to converge towards a (or multiple) structure(s) adapted to algorithms 
exploiting GPUs and many-core architectures.

The current objective is to write a first implementation in Rust, to then 
improve the structure without having to deal with data races and similar 
issues, thanks to the language's guarantees.

## Usage

The [user guide][UG] provides an overview of everything available in the 
project.

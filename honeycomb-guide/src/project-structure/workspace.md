# Workspace

The project root is organized using Cargo workspaces at the moment. This may change when other languages are
introduced to the project.

## Members

These entries are members of the Cargo workspace.

- [honeycomb-core](honeycomb-core.html) *Core definitions and tools for combinatorial map implementation*
- [honeycomb-benches](honeycomb-benches.html) *Benchmarks of the main map structures and methods*
- [honeycomb-examples](honeycomb-examples.html) *Examples of usage of the project's features*
- [honeycomb-render](honeycomb-render.html) *Visualization tool for combinatorial maps*

## Others

These entries are additional sections that are not linked to the project through Cargo, most likely because they
require a different building process.

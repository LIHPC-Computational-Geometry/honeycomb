# Workspace

The project root is organized using Cargo workspaces at 
the moment. This may change when other languages are 
introduced to the project.

## Members

These entries are members of the Cargo workspace.

- [honeycomb-core](honeycomb-core.html) *Core definitions and tools for combinatorial map implementation*
- [honeycomb-utils](honeycomb-utils.html) *Utility routines used in benchmarking and testing*

## Others

These entries are additional sections that are not linked to 
the project through Cargo, most likely because they require a 
different building process.

- [honeycomb-guide](honeycomb-guide.html) *Source files of the user guide*

# The Honeycomb User Guide

## Honeycomb

Honeycomb aims to provide a safe, efficient and scalable implementation of 
combinatorial maps for meshing applications. More specifically, the goal is
to converge towards a (or multiple) structure(s) adapted to algorithms 
exploiting GPUs and many-core architectures.

The current objective is to write a first implementation in Rust, to then 
improve the structure without having to deal with data races and similar 
issues, thanks to the language's guarantees.

### Requirements

- **Rust 1.75** - *The code may compile and work for earlier versions, but we do not test for those*

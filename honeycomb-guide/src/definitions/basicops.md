# Basic Operations

A number of basic operations are defined on combinatorial maps. In this section, we go over their definition, a simple
example and eventual implementation specificities. Qualifies as a basic operation:

- changing the dimension of the map
- adding and removing free darts from the map
- sewing and unsewing darts

Other operations might be defined, but these are the useful core for writing higher-level abstractions over
the structure.

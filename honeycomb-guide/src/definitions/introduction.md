# Introduction

## Scope

Because our implementation has very practical goals, the definitions 
presented here use a more intuitive approach rather than strict 
mathematical concepts.

Our main interest at the moment being 2D and 3D combinatorial maps,
some operations are defined with consideration to these restricitions.
This is especially useful for orbits and sewing operations.

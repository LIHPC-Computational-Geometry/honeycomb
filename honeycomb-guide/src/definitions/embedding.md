# Embedding

Embedding, or embedded data refers to the association of topological
entities (darts, *i*-cells) to geometrical data (spatial positions,
vertices, faces, volumes).

TODO: add illustration

The embedding of geometrical data also has implication for operations
on the map. This is detailed along operation specifities in their 
dedicated sections.

# Combinatorial Maps

Combinatorial maps are object made up of two main elements:

- A set of darts, darts being the smallest elements making up the map
- Beta functions, linking the darts of the map

Additionally, we can define "embedded" data as a spatial anchoring of
the darts making up the map. While the first two elements hold topological
information, the "embedded" data gives information about the "shape" of 
the map (e.g. vertices position in a spatial domain).

With these elements, we can represent and operate on meshes.
